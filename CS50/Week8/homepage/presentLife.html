        <h1>Present Life</h1>
        <p>I'm currently employed as an operating room nurse.
            My job's main focus is on ensuring that patients remain safe during their entire surgery,
            and that the surgeries go as smoothly and efficiently as possible.

        <p>Although it can be quite stimulating and dull moments are rare,
            working in a job where people's lives depend on me can be stressful.
            The height of which was during the COVID pandemic.
            I was reassigned to the COVID ward.
            I knew I needed to leave.

            Then I discovered software development. Listed as one of the least stressful jobs with amazing pay,
            plus possibility of working from home. It was like a dream job to me because I also liked tinkering with computers.

            That's why I'm currently taking CS50x! In hopes of soon switching careers into software development.
